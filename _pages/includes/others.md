* Advisor: Dr. Xiaoyuan Yi, Dr. Xing Xie
  On the Dynamics of LLMs' Values as A Community
- Engineered a scalable multi-agent system facilitating interactions among up to hundreds of AI agents, incorporating reflection mechanisms, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and parallel processing.
- Applied social science theories (e.g., Schwartz's Theory of Basic Values) as the theoretical frameworks to
  model and analyze the evolution of AI agents' values through social interactions.
- Utilized Social Network Analysis to examine the formation, structure and change of social networks among
  agents with diverse values.
- Leveraged GraphRAG and NLP to investigate Social Emergence (e.g., unique language, cultural practices,
  organizations and institutions) in LLM-agent communities.
- Designed and conducted experiments to assess the impact of value diversity, population size, and temporal
  factors on agent interactions and social outcomes.
