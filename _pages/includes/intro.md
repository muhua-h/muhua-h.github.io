# üßë‚Äçüé® About Me
Hello! I‚Äôm Muhua Huang, a Master‚Äôs student in Computational Social Science at the 
University of Chicago. I received my Bachelor's degree from University of British Columbia (UBC),
with a double major in Computer Science and Psychology (Honors). I am passionate about 
exploring the intersection of human behavior, computational methods, and artificial intelligence. 

My past research spans across Computational Social Science, Social Computing, Human-centered AI, Social Psychology and 
Quantitative Psychology.In my research project, I leverage theories in Sociology and Psychology and various computational 
tools including Natural Language Process, Machine Learning, Social Network Analysis and statistical 
models for behavioral science (e.g., Structural Equation Modelling,Factor Analysis and Regression).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Computational Social Science, Human-centered AI (HAI), and Social 
Computing, driven by three fundamental questions.  
1. Instead of having AIs to mimic or replace humans, how can we 
use AI to facilitate research endeavors and augment human capabilities? 
2. How do AI systems fundamentally differ from human intelligence, and what novel frameworks can we develop to study 
their unique characteristics? 
3. Given that LLMs represent a compressed form of collective human knowledge, what new insights about human behavior 
society can we uncover by studying their internal representations?
