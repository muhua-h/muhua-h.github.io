I am a PhD student in Organizational Behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, broadly studying personality, culture, values, and cognition within the space of Computational Social Science.  
I am also a member of UChicago [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) and the [Stanford–Berkeley Computational Culture Lab](https://www.comp-culture.org/).

# 👤 About Me  
I am intrigued by big questions about humans, society, and AI:

- Instead of having AI mimic or replace humans, how can we use it to facilitate research and augment human capabilities?  
- How do AI systems fundamentally differ from human intelligence, and what new theories or frameworks can we develop to study their unique characteristics?  
- Given that large language models represent a compressed form of collective human knowledge, what new insights about human behavior and society can we uncover by studying their internal representations?  

At Stanford, I am (1) developing a new theoretical framework to understand and conceptualize AI’s values and (2) investigating AI’s cognition and representations through a social science lens.  

Previously, I completed my **M.A. in Computational Social Science** at **The University of Chicago**, advised by [Dr. James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans), where we explored ways to use Generative Agent-Based Modelling to simulate psychological and social phenomena. 
Together, we explored how Generative Agent-Based Modelling can be used to simulate psychological 
and social phenomena. Dr. Evans has profoundly influenced me in many dimensions: 
he taught me to pursue bold ideas with confidence, support others generously, and carry a strong, decisive energy into everything I do. His motto—“gives a week, takes a week; gives a minute, takes a minute”—continues to guide how I approach research and life.

Before that, I earned my **B.A. in Computer Science and Psychology (Honours)** from **The University of 
British Columbia**, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Victoria Savalei](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/victoria-savalei/), 
[Dr. Kristin Laurin](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kristin-laurin/), and 
[Dr. Christina Conati](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~conati/). Their patience, rigor, and unwavering
support helped me find my footing in research and build a strong foundation for interdisciplinary
work. At UBC, I explored topics from psychometric modeling of personality to socioeconomic 
cognition and explainable AI—experiences that continue to shape my curiosity and approach to 
scientific inquiry.

My research has since expanded through collaborations at **Microsoft Research Asia** with 
[Dr. Xiaoyuan Yi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yixiaoyuan/) and 
[Dr. Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/), where we examine AI 
alignment problems.  

Across all my recent projects, I aim to build a *computational psychology of AI*: a framework that treats intelligent systems as evolving and active social participants that reflect and reshape human society.
